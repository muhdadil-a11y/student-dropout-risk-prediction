# Student Dropout Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of student dropout using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to help educational institutions identify students who may need early academic support.

## Objective
- Predict the probability of student dropout  
- Classify students into different risk categories  
- Enable timely academic intervention and support  

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost (final selected model)  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- Joblib  

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from publicly available educational datasets such as Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset is not included in this repository to keep it lightweight and to follow standard best practices.
